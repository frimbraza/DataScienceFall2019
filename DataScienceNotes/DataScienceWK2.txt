TERMS
Features: Humdity & Tempearture
Classifier: Predictive model
Labels: Rainy & Sunny Day

Training Stage(Modeling): 
Testing Stage(Prediction):

Supervised learnig: learning for labeled observations (eg. rain/sunny)
Unsupervised learning: unlabeled data
Semi-supervised learning: part of training is labeled
Reinforcement learning: learn from agent taking part in environment for reward
Transfer learning: solve a problem and apply extracted data to related dataset
Active learning: labels added as needed

ASPECTS of supervised learning
Classification: Predict discrete valued output (categorical) -> Finds Classification
Regression: Predict continuous valued output (numeric) -> Finds target
 - linear 
 - quadratic

KNN (nearest neighbor)
Distance depend on unit of feature
