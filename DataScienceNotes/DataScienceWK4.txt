uncertainty or unpredictability: is a lack of information
entropy is the expected information. Measures amount of uncertainty

best features == one that reduces entropy the most

training a decision tree classifier(on final)

Discreting continuous attributes == Requires a brute force approach usually to see what minimizes entropy


NOTES ON LAB2
imports:
1. numpy
2. panda

numpy gives you common math functions like mean and standard deviation
panda gives you knew data structures and functions

data structures:
1. Series: takes a list and "serializes" or numbers it from 0 to range. Also makes them all the same data type
2. dataFrame: Basically a table with numbered rows and columns with names
    FUNCTIONS FOR DATAFRAME
    1. head() and tail(): first and last rows of a dataframe. 
    2. shape(): gives you rows by columns of the dataframe in a tuple
    3. columns: VARIABLE that returns a tuple of 2 items. First is a list of all the column names. Second is the datatype
    4. df[col_name] : returns the data frame as a series based on the column provided
    5. df[[col_names]] : returns the data frame as a NEW DATA FRAME with only the columns provided
    6. df[x:y] : works on rows in a range of a data frame 
    7. df.loc[row,col] : returns the cell value
         *extend this to work on multiple cells
